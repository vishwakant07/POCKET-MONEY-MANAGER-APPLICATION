# POCKET-MONEY-MANAGER-APPLICATION
# Our driving purpose that is how it help user is to manage pocket money a very common problem faced by every student during his graduation.
So basically, we have idea to set a target of spending money and when user reached to limit then this app will notify user by turning its background color to red.
So, in this app in design section, we used images, labels, buttons and background screen. Firstly, we created three global variables 1st is x to ask user ‘how much money user have’ then 2nd variable is pocket money and give it the value of x and 3rd one is saving target to set a target of saving money by user, then we create 5 buttons and named them charity, stationary, food, recharge and last one is rent. Then we set the price for each button to be deducted on clicking it from pocket money and we created a function I which we use if statement to sizing up that if saving target >pocket money then background color will be changed to red.
Then we create a new button to start for next month. If user click on it then it will ask how much money do you want to add and it will take user value and add this to variable of pocket money and again it will ask question of setting target to user and again whole code will run.
